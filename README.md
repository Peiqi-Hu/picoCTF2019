# picoCTF2019

I am new to ctf, and just started with picoCTF2019. While trying to finish the competition, I found it would be somewhat useful to write a simple program based on how to solving problems. So that it could deepen my knowledge on new concepts. On the other hand, it could also improve my programming skill. 

However, most of codes I put on here might be too brief. I will also copy and paste some codes which are useful for me to understand or just simply better solutions inside the corresponding python file. 

Happy coding. 
Happy hacking.
